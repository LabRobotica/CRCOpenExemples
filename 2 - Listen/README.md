## Description

Example commented with the minimum of functions required to initiate and terminate communication between LPC and CRC (making use of the eORL library provided by Comau), and to make use of the Listen mode.

This README aims to show you how to download the source code, compile the LPC code for C5GOpen using eORL, and execute.

## To download code and go to folder

     git clone https://github.com/labrobotica/CRCOpenExemples.git && cd "ExamplesC5GOPEN \ 2 - Listen '

## To compile code

    cmake. && make
